## Description
**CLI tool easy to use for developers who are not familiar with blockchain.**

: Smart contracts in the blockchain are uncommon development areas.
There are many things that developers are unfamiliar with DApp development.
Even if you create a contract by referring to several references, there is an entry barrier to learn how to deploy and how to use smart contracts.
`vvisp` is a command line interface (CLI) tool designed to reduce the learning curve.

**(1) Deploying a contract with a single line of command**

: Deploying smart contracts to a blockchain is very complex.
In order to deploy a contract, you must write your smart contract deployment codes as well as create smart contracts.
A developer needs to consider deploying multiple smart contracts in order for DApp.
`vvisp` defines deployment target as a simple configuration file and then deploys smart contracts by considering the dependencies automatically with a single line of command instead of hundreds lines of code.

**(2) Executing the contract function with one command line**

: Developers had to study the library, call the function, and manually write the function call code to execute the function of a contract.
This is a big entry barrier for developers who are unfamiliar with smart contract development.
However, `vvisp` is designed to execute a specific function of a contract with a single command line and to receive results without complex processes.

**(3) Supporting Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework**

: Additionally, `vvisp` supports USCF(Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework).
Even if developers do not have deep knowledge about upgradeability, they can easily use embedded upgradeable libraries at vvisp.
If you want more information about the Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework, you can take a look at the HAECHI-LABS [pdf file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H9gtmpiZ5zwIFwgHGOOvz9Oa8SAlpM5h/view?usp=sharing).

## Install

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) first.
Then, install [npm](https://npmjs.com/) and
```sh
$ npm install --global @haechi-labs/vvisp
```
or install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and
```sh
$ yarn global add @haechi-labs/vvisp
```

## Usage

If you want to see sample repository and demo, see [here](https://github.com/HAECHI-LABS/vvisp-sample).

**1. Start your project**
```sh
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
$ vvisp init
```
You don't have to do `` $ npm init `` or ``$ truffle init``.
We supports environment for [truffle](https://truffleframework.com/truffle) and it will make `package.json` automatically.

_[See details](./commands/README.md#init)_ for ``$ vvisp init``.

**2. Make your Contracts at `contracts/`**

Now, you can use `gen-script`, `compile` and `flatten` commands.

**3. Set `vvisp-config.js` file**

Please set environment variables in `vvisp-config.js` file.
See [here](../../CONFIGURATION.md#config) for more information about `vvisp-config.js`.
Now you can use `deploy-contract` command.

**4. Set `service.vvisp.json` file**

Please set information about your DApp service in `service.vvisp.json`.
See [here](../../CONFIGURATION.md#service) for more information about `service.vvisp.json`.
Now you can use `deploy-service` command.

Please see [CONFIGURATION.md](../../CONFIGURATION.md) to configure your project.

Run `$ vvisp --help` for more details about functions of vvisp.

## Commands

Please see linked documentation below:
- [init](./commands/README.md#init): Start your project
- [compile](./commands/README.md#compile): Compile solidity contract files
- [deploy-contract](./commands/README.md#deploy-contract): Deploy contract
- [deploy-service](./commands/README.md#deploy-service): Deploy service of your contracts
- [gen-script](./commands/README.md#gen-script): Generate javascript APIs interacting with smart contract on blockchain
- [console](./commands/README.md#console): Provides a console environment that can invoke contracts interactively.
- [flatten](./commands/README.md#flatten): Flatten several contract files in one file
